============

This is a project that allows students to suggest, schedule, view, and RSVP to lightning talks. Users will also be able to vote talks.

As a user... I would like to be able to:

-Login, logout, and change password
-See all talks in a feed
-See talks I have voted
-See talks I have suggested
-Edit my talks
-Delete my talks
-Set a minimum amount of attendies in order to schedule talk
-Set a maximum amount of guests per talk
-Add tags to talks I create
